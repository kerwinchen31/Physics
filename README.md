## WHAT IS IT?
This is a fun physics game! The concept of this game is based on the physics of gun recoil, and thus the conservation of momentum, frictional forces, and one-dimensional kinematics.

## HOW IT WORKS
You (playing as the block) shoot a bullet in one direction, relying on the recoil to get to a “base” on the opposite side. You are given five bullets for each level, and there are six levels in total. If you reach the base within those five attempts, you will be able to move on to the next level. If you are unable to do so, or end up landing in the water with the monsters, you die. 


## HOW TO USE IT
Click SETUP to begin playing the game. Click SHOOT in order to move. You can adjust the direction the bullet is shot in and input the velocity of the bullet.
The monitors will tell you what level you are on, the frictional constant, the distance away from the base, and how many bullets are left in the level. The frictional constants and distances are set, but randomized for each level.
